**Airlines Performance & Customer Insights project in SQL**

**Background**
Our project focuses on the airline industry, where customer satisfaction plays a crucial role in building brand loyalty and improving service quality. With intense competition and operational challenges, it's vital for airlines to understand the key factors driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze airline customer data using SQL to uncover actionable insights into customer satisfaction and operational performance. The analysis focuses on evaluating key service quality indicators (like food, seat comfort, Wi-Fi), customer demographics, and flight metrics (like delays), to help stakeholders make informed business and customer experience decisions.

**Problem Statement 1**: Customer Satisfaction Insights
1. What percentage of passengers are satisfied vs. dissatisfied?
2. Which features (Wi-Fi, seat comfort, food, etc.) have the strongest correlation with satisfaction?
3. Compare satisfaction between business vs. leisure travellers.
4. Analyse satisfaction by flight class (Economy, Business, etc.).
5. Study age-wise and gender-wise satisfaction trends.
6. Identify top complaints among dissatisfied customers.

**Problem Statement 2: Operational Performance Metrics**
1. Find the average departure and arrival delays for satisfied vs. dissatisfied passengers.
2. Determine the percentage of flights delayed (arrival & departure).
3. Identify the top 5 most delayed flight routes.
4. Compare baggage handling ratings between satisfied vs. dissatisfied passengers.
5. Check if online booking convenience impacts overall satisfaction.

**Problem Statement 3: Customer Behaviour Analysis**
1. Find the top 10 most frequent flyers.
2. Understand trends among high-value or repeat customers.
3. Segment and target passengers based on travel type (business vs. leisure).
